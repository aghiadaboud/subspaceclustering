This repository includes an implementation of SUBCLU and FIRES and an evaluation of their performances in Python. To reproduce the figures and tables in `'ba.pdf'`, please run the following command in the ba_aghied_aboud directory:
```
bash run.sh
```
All plots will be saved in subspaceclustering/images. The remaining results will be printed on the console.
